<h3>>> Stop Using Burp Intruder for HTTP Attacks</h3>
The community edition of BURP Intruder has been throttled and <b>intentionally retarded</b> so you're expected to pay $400.00 if you play wargames and want results sometime this century. I play the same wargames and get the same flags but I never use BURP and after reading this you won't have to, either. <br>
<br>For the same $400.00 investment into your hacking hobby you can level up and diversify your skills by purchasing and playing around with <b><a href="https://shop.hak5.org/products/omg-cable">the o.mg cable</a></b> , <b><a hfre="https://shop.flipperzero.one/">a flipper zero</a></b> , <b><a href="https://account.shodan.io/billing">a shodan membership</a></b> and still have money left to enjoy <b><a href="https://www.joltcola.com/buy"">a jolt cola</a></b> at 3am while hacking from mother's basement. The choice is an easy one.<br>
<br>Furthermore, BURP is written in JAVA.

<h3>>> Use FFUF to Conduct the Same Attacks Without the Nonsense</h3>

Forgive BURP Intruder's attack names - they are just <b><a href="https://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/business-stat/otherapplets/comcount.htm">COMBINATORIAL</a></b> attacks which seem to have been renamed by a <b>mall ninja</b> or Steven Seagal in a balaclava trying to break into a donut shop with a toughbook, or something.
<br><br>
The only thing that makes them different is the attack complexity, which is defined by how many payloads and vectors are required to conduct the attack, and in the case of the default attack type, the order in which the payloads are processed. That's it. The rest is <b>mall ninja </b>nonsense.<br>
<br><b><a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf">FFUF</b></a> works the attack surface by assigning keywords to vectors and labeling payloads with the associated keyword. 'Clusterbomb' is the default attack mode for FFUF so be careful of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion">COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSION</a></b> when conducting attacks with multiple payloads. 
(i really <i>can't</i> with these names - "Combinatorial Explosion" is just when the operation is multiplicative and not additive; so the attack will take too long because your payloads are too big and too many). If using mathematical terminology for preforming operations in discrete space is too much dont worry <b>FFUF speaks mall ninja</b> and the attack type can be specified on the command line with:
<code>-mode</code>

<h3>>> Embrace Your Browser's Native Power</h3>
<p>
Since I value convention, W3C standards, and ad-blockers, I use Mozilla Firefox which has the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd> to display the browser's network requests. Your browser's shortcut may be different but all the popular browsers have a network tab in the <b>developer tools</b>, usually opened by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd>.
When viewing the network monitoring tab right click on the request and select <b>EDIT AND RESEND</b>. This feature is AMAZING and is essentially the same as repeater but you dont have to install anything, and it's free. If your browser doesn't display EDIT AND RESEND when you right click on a request in the network monitor, go to <strong>about:config</strong> and make sure u set
<br><br><code>devtools.netmonitor.features.newEditAndResend</code> to <code><strong>FALSE</strong></code>
<br><br> This native feature of the web browser is excellent and when used correctly 11 of 10 hackers agree: <b>it greatly reduces your addiction to and reliance on <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater/using">burp repeater</a></b>. 
<br><br> It's so easy to use. Similar to how burp repeater defines positions in a http request, <b> with your browser's native tooling you can save the request into a file</b> to produce a quick and easy attack surface wherein which distinct vectors may be defined or you can copy the request as a curl command <b>which is just two steps away from being a viable FFUF command</b>.
<br><br> Get used to using the browser's native network request features and your power level will rise above 9000.

<h3>>> Ditch Decoder for CyberChef</h3>

<p>
BURP tries to be a one-stop-shop for all things web, and in overextending itself, fails to deliver a comprehensive and proper decoder. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.gchq.gov.uk/news/cyberchef-cyber-swiss-army-knife"><b>gchq</b></a> has saved us from such uninspired mediocrity by releasing
<a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/"><b>Cyber Chef</b></a> - a simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/"><b>Cyber Chef</b></a> supports more encoding methods, can guess hash types, and even has this feature called 'magic' which dumps useful tables to skim through.
<br><br>I've totally replaced BURP decoder with this more powerful and specialized tool. The only thing BURP decoder does well is exemplify why some things should stop trying to be monoliths in complex domains.

<h3>>> Exploring Faster Attack Scenarios Using FFUF</h3>
<p>    
<b><a href="https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop#from-sources">install owasp juice shop</a></b> according to the instructions on github, and set your hosts file to resolve mall.ninja locally:
<br><br>
<code>echo '127.0.0.1 mall.ninja' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts</code>
<br><br>

<h4>Sniper-to-FFUF</h4>
<p>
This is the most basic attack type that can be conducted with BURP Intruder. It takes only one payload set, mapped to a keyword defined in an attack vector. This keyword is arbitrary and can be anything you want, but the default is <b>FUZZ</b>. As with every attack in BURP Intruder, <b>the amount of threads is intentionally retarded</b> and as a bonus: <b>you can't use larger payload sets at all</b>. 
<br><br>LOL
<br><br>
For the Sniper-to-FFUF example we're going to <b>use FFUF to brute force the POST method of a login form by fuzzing the password part of its JSON payload</b>. 
<br><br>For this to work we require an existing email to use with the password we'll be fuzzing in the request. Fortunately, the juice shop is kind enough to provide us with email addresses in the user reviews.
<br><br>Click on the apple juice and then expand the reviews to find an email address.
<br><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DFqMbBx.png">
<br><br> We get the email address, <code>admin@juice-sh.op</code> from the review. 
<br><br> Next, open the dev tools on your browser by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> and go to the network tab, then try to <a href="http://mall.ninja:3000/#/login"><b>login</a></b> with any password. I used the email <code>admin@juice-sh.op</code> and the password <code>katanacollector</code>
<br><br> Find the POST request to login in your network tab, right click it, and copy as curl.
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/buUjt5w.gif">
<br><br>
Depending on your environment, the contents in your clipboard may vary but should be something like,
<br><br>
<code>
curl 'http://mall.ninja:3000/rest/user/login' -X </strong> POST -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Origin: http://mall.ninja:3000' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: http://mall.ninja:3000/' -H 'Cookie: language=en; welcomebanner_status=dismiss; cookieconsent_status=dismiss' --data-raw '{"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"katanacollector"}'
</code>
<br><br>
which is just two steps away from being viable as a command for <b>FFUF</b>. The <code>curl</code> and <code>--data-raw</code> parts of the command just need to be changed; <code>curl</code> to <code>ffuf -u</code> and <code>--data-raw</code> shortened to <code>-d</code>.
</p>
Before using <b>FFUF</b> we require information from the webserver to use with FFUF's filter. To brute force a login request it's best to compare against an invalid password response from the server, so we can filter out that noise and view whatever else.
<p>Create and run a shortened version of the <code>curl</code> command obtained from the browser; using only necessary headers:
<br><br>
<code>curl 'http://mall.ninja:3000/rest/user/login' -X POST  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"katanacollector"}'</code>
<br><br>
<p>
The server responds with <code>Invalid email or password.</code> which is the string we can use with the FUFF's regex filter <code>-fr</code> to get rid of any bad login responses containing that string. 
<br><br>For this attack we need to define a vector in the request, and identify where the payloads are. 
<br><br>This is done with a keyword. The keywords can be whatever you like but for this example that keyword is going to be (the default) <strong>FUZZ</strong>. To identify the position in the vector just write the keyword <strong>FUZZ</strong> instead of <strong>katanacollector</strong> where the password is supposed to be in the request. 
<br><br>Now that we've identified a vector with a keyword we need to associate the keyword with a payload of inputs for the fuzzer to use. For this we're going to be using <b><a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/100k-most-used-passwords-NCSC.txt">the top 100k most used password list</a></b> daniel miessler got from the NCSC who got it from troy hunt who compiled other people's dumps. 
<br><br>The pathname is long, and in the interest of brevity in the next command, save this list as 100k.txt (or if you already have it, copy and rename it in the current working directory).
<br><br>To convert the curl command to a FFUF command: change the <code>curl</code> part to <code>ffuf -u</code> and shorten the <code>--data-raw</code> to just <code>-d</code>. Define the wordlist payload with <code>-w</code>, and set the filter to be on the lookout for bad response string by adding <code>-fr</code> with the string "Invalid email or password." from earlier to get the final form for ffuf:
<br><br><code>ffuf -u 'http://mall.ninja:3000/rest/user/login' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"<strong><font color="#FFFFFF">FUZZ</strong></font>"}' -w 100k.txt<strong><font color="#FFFFFF">:FUZZ</font></strong> -fr "Invalid email or password."</code>
<br><br><strong>Notice the word <b>FUZZ</b> where the password would be in the JSON payload, and again the label <b>:FUZZ</b> after the wordlist. This tells FFUF that when it sees the word FUZZ in the request, to use the payload labeled FUZZ for the input. We don't <strong>have to</strong> do this with only one payload set but it's good practice to get into for when working with many.</strong>
<br><br>After about 30 seconds, we get a result

<hr>










<h4>"BATTERING RAM"</h4>
<p>This is the same as sniper except the same payload can be used in multiple positions. Since there is only one payload, we could use the default keyword <b>FUZZ</b> instead of defining a custom one but to get into the habit we will use 
</p>
<br><br>

<h4>"PITCHFORK"</h4>
<p>Pitchfork iterates through payloads simultaneously. The typical use case for this is credential stuffing and some request parameter fuzzing.
<code>blahbalbhalbh</code>
</p>

<h4>"CLUSTER BOMB"</h4>
<p>
This is FFUF's default mode for processing multiple payloads. The order of the payloads matters because <b>subsequent payloads will not advance until the previous set has been exhausted</b>, whereas in other attacks the sets process and advance position simultaneously.
